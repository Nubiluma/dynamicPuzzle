# dynamicPuzzle

This project is a Tetris-like puzzle game which can be played in IntelliJ's console through user input and System out printing.

You can choose between three randomly generated pieces to place on the field. New choice pieces will be generated after every third round.
Like Tetris, you will get points when you manage to fill at least one complete row and/or column. (The more rows and columns are filled at once, the higher the points gained.)
Full rows and columns will be cleared after counting and before the next round of game.
You lose if your available choice pieces cannot be placed on the game field, due to lack of space.

The game will tell you what to do (and what not to do) in every step in every round!
